## Different Stays
### 8 day ayahuasca retreat
A plant diet is a sacred process. Once you start, it's very important you stick to the restrictions and finish. If you're unsure if you can do that, you can do ceremonies outside of diet. These are incredibly healing on their own.

If an emergency comes up, or you realize this isn't for you, you can leave without consequence. This may be appropriate for people doing ayahuasca for the first time, or those with obligations they can't entirely disconnect from.

### 11 day master plant diet
Our shortest diets are an 11-day stay, with 9 days in the diet. Olinda will guide you to a plant to diet based on your intentions.Please tell us if there is any plant that is calling to you.

The ayahuasca ceremonies at the beginning and end open and close your diet. You'll have three master plant ceremonies near the beginning where you take your plant.

### 20 day master plant diet
The 20-day stay has 18 days in the diet and allows for the possibility of dieting two plants.

### 32 day master plant diet
This time allows for a deeper connection with plants.

### Custom stays
We can accommodate a stay of any length 8 days or longer. For example, 17 days allows for a 15-day diet and a great connection with the plant. We've had dieters reside here up to three months.


# Transportation
You'll arrive in Pucallpa the day before your arrival to Paoyhan. You'll purchase a boat or car ticket (~30 USD), depending on the road conditions. Gladys will help you. The return is the same.

Mention the hotel.
