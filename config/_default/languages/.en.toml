### Authentic Ayahuasca dietas in the Amazon.
___
What makes our healing center truly special is that it is **family-owned and operated by the Shipibo people**, the guardians of ancestral plant medicine. Unlike many other centers, our deep-rooted connection to this tradition grants unparalleled access to authentic Shipibo shamans, offering you a **profound and immersive healing experience**.

Nestled in a **serene location in Paoyhan**, our retreats provide a secluded and intimate setting. Here, you can fully embrace the wisdom of the plants, guided by generations of Shipibo healers in a space designed for deep transformation and self-discovery.
