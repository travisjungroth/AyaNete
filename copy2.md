# General
What's special about this center is that it's Shipibo family owned and operated. They have access to the shamans and can learn much more than at other places. Unlike most other centers in Paoyhan, it's out of town and much quieter.

## What you're paying for
You're paying for your stay. We don't charge for medicine or treatments. This also means we'll only do things we believe in, that we think are right for that person at that moment.

# Guide
## Why people do it
### Healing
Healing from past traumas, deciding where to go at a crossroads in your life, healing physical ailments.
### Learning
Deepening a connection with plants.
## Ayahuasca Ceremonies
Every two or three nights, depending on the schedule and length of stay of people there. They're at night. Lots of singing, called icaros.
## Dieta
### Food
No sugar, salt, oil, spices, red meat or pork. Grains, vegetables, fruit, root vegetables. Sometimes eggs and chicken. We can do vegan and vegetarian diets.
### Restrictions
Limited conversation, focus on the connection with the plant. No internet or books.
### Preparation
Good to start the food diet five days ahead of time. Be off medications, stop sex.
### Post Dieta
Same thing, maybe five days depending on the length of the diet.
## Plants
In your dieta, you connect with another plant. These are called teacher plants, master plants, and palos maestros. Different plants have different properties. We'll talk with you when you arrive to determine your plant. Please let us know if there's a specific plant you're called to. Some plants we work with are Bobinsana, Chiric Sanango, Ajo Sacha, Renaquilla, Renaco, Tamamoori, and Noya Rao.
## Length
Minimum of a week. People generally do up to 30 days. Certain plants, like trees, call for a longer dieta. If you do 20 days or more, you might diet two plants. 
## Ayahuasca Retreat
Once you start a dieta, it's very important you finish. If you're less sure, like you haven't done these ceremonies before or you have responsibilities at home that could pull you away, you can do an Ayahuasca retreat. The process is the same except you don't spiritually open a dieta and you can stop without ill effects. (I don't want to scare people that are in the dieta, like they're trapped.)
## Treatments
Sauna, plant bath, optional vomitivo.
### Weather
Temperature, rainfall.
